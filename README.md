The code for this project is hosted at : 
https://github.com/KUSALA-sura/E-Commerce-Website-For-Sporty-Shoes-Phase3

The project is developed by SURA KUSALA


1.1	Project Description:

Project objective:
As a Full Stack Developer, complete the features of the application by planning the development and pushing the source code to the GitHub repository. 
      
Background of the problem statement:
Sporty Shoes is a company that manufactures and sells sports shoes. They have a walk-in store, and now, they wish to launch their e-commerce portal sportyshoes.com.
 
You’re asked to develop a prototype of the application. It will be then presented to the relevant stakeholders for budget approval. Your manager has set up a meeting where you’re asked to do the following: 
● Presenting the specification document which has the product’s capabilities, appearance, and user interactions
● Setting up Git and GitHub account to store and track your enhancements of the prototype 
● Explaining the Java concepts used in the project 
● Discussing the generic features of the product:
● There will be an admin to manage the website. An administrator login will be required to access the admin page. 
 
The admin should be able to change his password if he wants, he should be able to:
● Manage the products in the store including categorizing them
● Browse the list of users who have signed up and be able to search users
● See purchase reports filtered by date and category
	
1.2	Core concepts used in the project:
		-> Used Java Language in Eclipse IDE.
  		-> File Handling
		-> Spring framework
-> Flow Control
-> Recursion
-> Exception Handling
-> Streams API 
TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS USED:

 Spring MVC: to build web applications as it follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
• JSP: to handle the presentation view.
• Hibernate: to simplify the development and the interaction with the database.
• CSS: to format the contents.
• Bootstrap: to use some CSS and JavaScript designs.
• Maven: to manage the project.
• Eclipse: to write and run the code.
• phpMyAdmin: to administrate and manage the database manually.
• Tomcat: to run and deploy servlet application.

2.1	Project Users Stories : ( Agile and Scrum )


The project is planned to be completed in 3 sprints. Tasks assumed to be completed in the sprint are:
•	Creating the flow of the application
•	Initializing git repository to track changes as development progresses.
•	Writing the Java program to fulfill the requirements of the project.
•	Testing the Java program with different kinds of User input
•	Pushing code to GitHub.
1) As an admin I can Set up a product list of all the shoes.
2) As an admin I can Delete any shoe product.
3) As an admin I can Manage users.
4) As an admin I can change new password.
5)As a User, I can add product to the list.
The goal of the company is to deliver a high-end quality product as early as possible. 


Sprint 1
1)	Create database and tables.
2)	Add all dependencies to the Maven project.Connect the database to the project.
3)	Create the models’ classes.Create the data access object classes using Hibernate.
Sprint 2
1)	Create login and register pages.Show all products to the home page.
2)	Add products to the cart.Show user’s cart. Create user’s update page.
3)	Enable the admin to add a new product. Enable the ability to search for a specific product.
Sprint 3
1)	Make the admin able to update and remove a product. Make the admin manage the users. 
2)	Make the admin manage the orders. Add CSS file and use Bootstrap to format the pages. Debug and test the project.
3)	Push the code to the GitHub.

Demonstrating the product capabilities, appearance, and user interactions

To demonstrate the product capabilities, below are the sub-sections configured to highlight appearance and user interactions for the project:
Step 1: Creating a new project in Eclipse
●	Open Eclipse
●	Go to File -> New -> Project -> Maven Project -> Next.
●	Type in any project name and click on “Finish.”
●	Select your project and go to File -> New -> Class.


All above mentioned file are attached via zip file all these are

 

Step 4: Pushing the code to GitHub repository
●	Open your command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have created your files.
cd <folder path>
●	Initialize repository using the following command:
git init
●	Add all the files to your git repository using the following command:
git add .
●	Commit the changes using the following command:
git commit .  -m  <commit message>
●	Push the files to the folder you initially created using the following command:
git push -u origin master

Unique Selling Points of the Application
